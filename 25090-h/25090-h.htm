<h1>THE TALE OF BILLY<br />WOODCHUCK</h1>

<h2><a name="I" id="I"></a>I</h2>

<h2>THE HOUSE IN THE PASTURE</h2>


<p>One day, when Johnnie Green tramped
over the fields toward the woods, he did
not dream that he walked right over somebody&rsquo;s
bedroom. The snow was deep, for
it was midwinter. And as Johnnie
crossed his father&rsquo;s pasture he thought
only of the fresh rabbit tracks that he saw
all about him. He had no way of knowing
that beneath the three feet of snow,
and as much further below the top of the
ground too, there was a snug, cozy little
room, where Mr. and Mrs. Woodchuck<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
lay sound asleep on a bed of dried grass.</p>

<p>They had been there all winter, asleep
like that. And there they would stay,
until spring came and the grass began to
grow again.</p>

<p>In summer Johnnie Green was always
on the watch for woodchucks. But now he
never gave them a thought. There would
be time enough for that after the snow was
gone and the chucks came crawling out of
their underground houses to enjoy the
warm sunshine.</p>

<p>Usually it happened in just that way,
though there had been years when Mr. and
Mrs. Woodchuck had awakened too soon.
And then when they reached the end of
the long tunnel that led from their bedroom
into Farmer Green&rsquo;s pasture they
found that they had to dig their way
through a snow-bank before they reached
the upper world where Johnnie Green<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
lived.</p>

<p>But this year their winter&rsquo;s nap came to
a close at just the right time. A whole
month had passed since Johnnie walked
over their house. And now when they
popped their heads out of their front door
they saw that the snow was all gone and
that the sun was shining brightly. Almost
the first thing they did was to nibble at
the tender young grass that grew in their
dooryard.</p>

<p>When you stop to remember that
neither of them had had so much as a
single mouthful of food since long before
Thanksgiving Day you will understand
how hungry they were.</p>

<p>They were very thin, too. But every
day they grew a little fatter. And when
at last Johnnie Green passed that way
again, late one afternoon, to drive the cows
home to be milked, he thought that Mrs.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
Woodchuck looked quite well.</p>

<p>She looked happy, too, just before
Johnnie came along. But now she had a
worried air. And it was no wonder,
either. For she had five new children,
only a few weeks old, and she was afraid
that Johnnie would take them away from
her.</p>

<p>Poor, frightened Mrs. Woodchuck ran
round and round her five youngsters, to
keep them all together. And all the time
she urged them nearer and nearer the door
of her house.</p>

<p>Johnnie was already late about getting
the cows. But he waited to see what happened.
And soon he saw all five of the
little chucks scramble through the doorway.
And as soon as the last one was
safely inside the old lady jumped in after
her children.</p>

<p>That last one was the biggest of all the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
young chucks. Perhaps it was because he
always ate twice as much as any of his
brothers and sisters. His mother found
him harder to manage, too; and she had
to push him along through the doorway,
because he wanted to stop and snatch a
bite from a juicy plantain.</p>

<p>That was Billy Woodchuck&mdash;that fat,
strong youngster. Even then Johnnie
Green knew that he was going to be a big
fellow when he grew up.</p>

<h2>CALLING NAMES</h2>


<p>Billy Woodchuck grew so fast that he
soon looked very much like his father. Of
course, he was still much smaller than
Mr. Woodchuck. But like him, Billy was
quite gray; and he had whiskers, too&mdash;though,
to be sure, those were black. His
eyes also were black and large and
bright. When Billy sat up on his hind
legs&mdash;as he often did&mdash;he appeared for all
the world like a huge squirrel.</p>

<p>In fact, some of Billy&rsquo;s friends remarked
how like a squirrel he looked. And
one day when Billy was playing near the
edge of the woods a disagreeable young
hedgehog told him that. To tell the truth,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
Billy Woodchuck had grown to be the
least bit vain. He loved to gaze upon his
bushy tail; and he spent a good deal of
time stroking his whiskers. He hoped
that the neighbors had noticed them.</p>

<p>Now, other people are always quick to
see when anyone is silly in that way. And
the young hedgehog thought that Billy
Woodchuck needed taking down a peg.
So he said to him:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you join the circus?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Circus? What&rsquo;s that?&rdquo; Billy asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A circus is a place where they have all
kinds of freaks,&rdquo; the hedgehog answered
with a sly smile&mdash;&ldquo;giants and dwarfs, and
thin people and fat people.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But I&rsquo;m not a freak,&rdquo; Billy Woodchuck
replied. &ldquo;Of course, I&rsquo;m big for
my age. But I&rsquo;m not a giant.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, you are,&rdquo; the hedgehog insisted.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re a giant squirrel. You look like<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
<i>him</i>&rdquo;&mdash;he pointed to a young fellow
called Frisky Squirrel&mdash;&ldquo;only you&rsquo;re ever
so much bigger.&rdquo;</p>

<p>That made Billy Woodchuck very
angry. And he began to chatter and scold.</p>

<p>Wise old Mr. Crow, who sat in a tree
nearby, told him to keep his temper.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Certainly you are not a squirrel,&rdquo; he
said. &ldquo;It is nonsense to say that a ground
hog is the same as a squirrel&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Billy Woodchuck&rsquo;s voice broke into a
shrill scream. A <i>ground hog</i>! He was
terribly angry.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, yes!&rdquo; Mr. Crow said, nodding
his head with a knowing air. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re a
marmot, you know.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, I&rsquo;m not!&rdquo; Billy cried. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m a
woodchuck! That&rsquo;s what I am. And I&rsquo;m
going home and tell my mother what horrid
names you&rsquo;ve been calling me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mr. Crow laughed. He said nothing<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
more. But as Billy hurried away he could
hear the young hedgehog calling:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ground hog! Marmot! Ground hog!
Marmot!&rdquo; over and over again.</p>

<p>Billy Woodchuck was surprised to see
how calm his mother was when he told her
those horrid names. He had rather expected
that she would hurry over to the
woods and say a few things to that young
hedgehog, and to old Mr. Crow as well.
But she only said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be silly! Of course you&rsquo;re a
ground hog. You&rsquo;re an American marmot,
too. Though our family has been
known in this neighborhood for many
years as the Woodchuck family, you
needn&rsquo;t be ashamed of either of those
other names. Isn&rsquo;t &lsquo;ground hog&rsquo; every
bit as good a name as &lsquo;hedgehog?&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Billy Woodchuck began to think it was.
And as for &ldquo;marmot&rdquo;&mdash;that began to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
have quite a fine sound in his ears.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why can&rsquo;t we change our name to
that?&rdquo; he asked his mother.</p>

<p>But Mrs. Woodchuck shook her head.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We are plain country people,&rdquo; she
said. &ldquo;Woodchuck is the best name for
us.&rdquo;</p>

<h2>MAGIC</h2>


<p>One of the first things Mrs. Woodchuck
taught her children was to beware of dogs
and foxes, minks and weasels, skunks and
great horned owls. She often made them
say the names of those enemies over and
over again.</p>

<p>For some time Billy Woodchuck was
almost afraid to stir out of doors, for fear
he might meet one of those creatures. But
at last as he grew bigger he grew bolder,
too. And he began to think that his
mother was just a nervous old lady. Still,
when he met a fox one day at the further
end of the pasture Billy was somewhat
frightened. But Mr. Fox seemed very<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
friendly. They talked together for a
while. And then Mr. Fox said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you like surprises?</p>

<p>&ldquo;I see you <i>do</i> like them,&rdquo; Mr. Fox continued.
&ldquo;Well, you just crawl inside that
old stump over there. There&rsquo;s a hole in
it, as you see. And in there you&rsquo;ll find
something to surprise you.&rdquo; Mr. Fox
stretched himself then. &ldquo;I must go home
now,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I was out late last night
and I feel like taking a nap.&rdquo; So off he
trotted, with never a look behind him.</p>

<p>He was hardly out of sight before Billy
Woodchuck hurried to the old stump and
crawled inside. But so far as he could
see, it was quite empty. And he was just
about to leave when all at once it grew
dark. That was because Mr. Fox had come
back and thrust his head through the
hole.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did you find it?&rdquo; Mr. Fox asked him.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;No!&rdquo; said Billy in a faint voice.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, well!&rdquo; said Mr. Fox. &ldquo;I must
be mistaken.... Yes, I know I am. It
was in another stump. Just step outside
and I&rsquo;ll show you which one.&rdquo; The hole
was too small for him to squeeze through.
If it had been bigger he would not have
bothered to ask Billy to come out.</p>

<p>Mr. Fox pulled his head back and
waited. But Billy Woodchuck did not
appear.</p>

<p>Soon Mr. Fox took another look inside
the hollow stump.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter?&rdquo; he asked.
&ldquo;Aren&rsquo;t you coming?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then <i>he</i> had a surprise. For Billy
Woodchuck was gone. Mr. Fox saw that
the old stump was empty.</p>

<p>He thought that Billy must have used
magic, to leave that place and run away
under his very eyes. For you may be sure<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
that Mr. Fox had kept a close watch on
the hole all the time. And he told all his
friends that Billy Woodchuck knew a way
to make himself invisible&mdash;a word which
means that <i>nobody could see him</i>.</p>

<p>Later, when Billy heard what people
were saying about him, he only looked wise
and said nothing.</p>

<p>But he had been sadly frightened when
Mr. Fox peeped inside the old stump.
And he had made up his mind at once that
he would not come out and be caught. He
knew better than that. For now he believed
everything his mother had told him
about foxes.</p>

<p>As his bright eyes looked about his
prison they soon spied a small hole which
seemed to lead down into the ground. It
was large enough for him to enter. And
so he went right down out of sight.</p>

<p>Billy found himself in a long tunnel,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
which made him think of one that led to
his own home. At the other end of it he
came out into daylight again; and he knew
then that it was an old woodchuck&rsquo;s burrow,
in which nobody lived any longer.
And it was the back door that opened into
the hollow stump.</p>

<p>Billy Woodchuck hurried home. He
thought that Mr. Fox would stay near the
old stump for some time, waiting for him
to come out.</p>

<p>Although he had been so frightened, it
was a good lesson for him. For he had
learned that no matter how pleasant a fox
might be, it was wise to have nothing to
do with him.</p>

<h2>THE GREAT HORNED OWL</h2>


<p>Billy Woodchuck knew that the Great
Horned Owl was a dangerous person. His
mother had often told him that. But he
had never yet seen the Great Horned
Owl; and Billy wondered how he should
know him if he should ever happen to
meet him. So Billy Woodchuck went indoors
and asked his mother to tell him how
the Great Horned Owl looked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s a big fellow,&rdquo; said Mrs. Woodchuck&mdash;&ldquo;almost
as big as the Great Gray
Owl and the Snowy Owl. But you can
tell him from them by his ear-tufts, which
stick up from his head like horns.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What color is he?&rdquo; Billy inquired.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Buff and black,&rdquo; Mrs. Woodchuck answered.
&ldquo;He&rsquo;s mottled&mdash;that means
about the same as spotted,&rdquo; she explained.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve heard him called the &lsquo;tiger among
birds.&rsquo; But whether it&rsquo;s because of the
spots, or because he&rsquo;s so fierce, I really
don&rsquo;t know.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Maybe it&rsquo;s <i>both</i>,&rdquo; Billy suggested.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Perhaps!&rdquo; his mother said. &ldquo;He has
a deep voice,&rdquo; she continued. &ldquo;And he
calls &lsquo;<i>Whoo, hoo-hoo-hoo, whoo, whoo!</i>&rsquo;
If you heard him in the woods you might
almost think it was old dog Spot barking.
But when he screams&rdquo;&mdash;Mrs. Woodchuck
shuddered&mdash;&ldquo;<i>then</i> you&rsquo;ll know him. For
his scream is the most dreadful sound that
was ever heard.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wish you would scream like him
once,&rdquo; said Billy.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Bless your heart!&rdquo; said his mother.
&ldquo;My voice may not be very sweet, but I<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
never could screech like him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why doesn&rsquo;t Johnnie Green shoot
him?&rdquo; Billy asked. &ldquo;If he only would,
the Great Horned Owl could never trouble
us any more.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, there&rsquo;s more than just <i>one</i>!&rdquo;
his mother exclaimed. &ldquo;When I say &lsquo;the
Great Horned Owl,&rsquo; I don&rsquo;t mean just
<i>one</i>!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; said Billy. That was different.
And then he went out to play again.</p>

<p>For a long time he couldn&rsquo;t get the
Great Horned Owl out of his mind. Every
time he heard the leaves rustle in the trees
he jumped as if forty Great Horned Owls
were after him. But since nothing of the
sort happened, at last he forgot all about
that danger. It was late in the afternoon
when a horrid call sent him scurrying off:</p>

<p>&ldquo;<i>Whoo, hoo-hoo-hoo, whoo, whoo!</i>&rdquo;</p>

<p>Billy Woodchuck was sure that the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
Great Horned Owl had found him at last.
He ran a little way as fast as he could;
and then he crouched down in the grass.</p>

<p>Again came that deep, long-drawn call.
It sent Billy off on another short run.</p>

<p>And after that had happened three
times, he was so scared that he thrust his
head under a heap of dried leaves. So
long as he couldn&rsquo;t see the Great Horned
Owl, he thought that the Great Horned
Owl couldn&rsquo;t see him.</p>

<p>Then Billy heard his mother&rsquo;s voice.
She was calling him. And he looked up
quickly. There she was, right beside him!</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did you drive him away, Mother?&rdquo;
he asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Whom do you mean?&rdquo; she inquired.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, the Great Horned Owl!&rdquo; Billy
said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I was the only one that called,&rdquo; she
told him. &ldquo;I wanted to see what you<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
would do. And I must say, you behaved
very foolishly. Don&rsquo;t ever cover up your
head like that. First, you must try to get
away. And if you should get caught, remember
that your teeth are sharp. But
they won&rsquo;t be of any use to you with your
head buried under a pile of leaves.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Billy Woodchuck saw that he had a
great deal to learn. But he was glad that
his mother had taught him that much,
though he was ashamed that he had been
so silly.</p>

<h2><a name="V" id="V"></a>V</h2>

<h2>BILLY STANDS GUARD</h2>


<p>Old Mr. Woodchuck had a great deal of
time on his paws. He was always telling
people how a stone once rolled off a wall
on top of him and hurt his back, so he
was not strong enough to do much work.
On pleasant days he was usually to be
found sunning himself. And often when
he leaned his lame back against a tree
where the sun fell squarely upon him he
would fall asleep and stay there for hours
at a time.</p>

<p>Though he did no work at all, his appetite
was always good. And when he heard
that there were ripe apples, or lettuce, or
some other dainty to be had, he always<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
managed to get to the feast about as early
as anybody else. At such times he seemed
to forget how much his back hurt him.</p>

<p>There came a day when Mr. Woodchuck
dashed home on a run. At first his
wife thought there must be a fox chasing
him. But as soon as he caught his breath
(he was so fat that running always made
him puff), he told Mrs. Woodchuck that
a party of his friends was going to make
a raid on Farmer Green&rsquo;s clover-field.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going with them,&rdquo; he said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you think you ought to?&rdquo; she
asked. &ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t it too far? Isn&rsquo;t your back
too lame?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mr. Woodchuck clapped his hands to
his back and groaned a bit.</p>

<p>&ldquo;They say there&rsquo;s nothing better for
my trouble than tender young clover-heads,&rdquo;
he replied. &ldquo;So I think I ought
to go.... What I came home for is this:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
We want some spry young fellow to come
along with us and be a sentinel. And I&rsquo;m
going to take Billy. He&rsquo;s old enough now
to make himself of some use.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want him to go,&rdquo; Mrs. Woodchuck
said. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s only a child.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He has ears, hasn&rsquo;t he? And eyes?&rdquo;
her husband replied. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s time he helped
me a little, after all I&rsquo;ve done for him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Billy Woodchuck was sure that he
wanted to go. He was listening to every
word.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s a sentinel?&rdquo; he asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A sentinel is a guard,&rdquo; his father told
him. &ldquo;It is his duty to sit upon a knoll
and watch for men and dogs, while his
friends eat the clover. And if he sees or
hears a man or a dog&mdash;or any other enemy&mdash;he
whistles as loud as he can. That&rsquo;s
the danger signal. And just as soon as
they hear it, all the other chucks run<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
away.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Please let me go, Mother!&rdquo; Billy
begged.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s very dangerous,&rdquo; Mrs. Woodchuck
objected.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No danger at all!&rdquo; Mr. Woodchuck
said. &ldquo;Come on!&rdquo;</p>

<p>And off they went, though Mrs. Woodchuck
was far from pleased.</p>

<p>Mr. Woodchuck hurried over to a big
oak, where his friends were waiting for
him. There were almost a dozen of them&mdash;fat,
elderly gentlemen. But they were
very spry about reaching the clover-field.</p>

<p>Billy felt proud as a peacock when they
left him alone on a knoll at the edge of
the clover-patch and told him to keep a
sharp ear out.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And remember! At the first sign of
danger, you must give a loud, shrill whistle,&rdquo;
his father warned him. Then Mr.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
Woodchuck hurried away.</p>

<p>Billy could see his father and the others
eating clover-tops as fast as they could
pull them off. And he soon began to think
that they were having more fun than he
was. He grew tired of sitting still in one
place. And just a little distance away
he noticed a clump of fine clover. As the
tops waved gently in the breeze they
seemed to beckon to him.</p>

<p>Soon Billy was eating clover, too. And
it was so good that he forgot all about being
a sentinel. He forgot all about listening
for danger. And then all at once he
heard a cry:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sick him, Spot!&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was Johnnie Green calling to his dog.</p>

<hr />
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span></p>
<h2><a name="VI" id="VI"></a>VI</h2>

<h2>BILLY FORGETS TO WHISTLE</h2>


<p>When Billy Woodchuck turned around
he saw that dog Spot was coming straight
toward him. Billy dropped the big clover-top
he was just cramming into his mouth;
and he ran as fast as he could go for a little
way. Then he stopped and crouched
low in the thick clover. But old Spot came
bounding after him.</p>

<p>Again Billy made a quick dash. Again
he stopped to hide. And this time what
should he see right in front of him but the
door of an old woodchuck&rsquo;s burrow! He
whisked inside it in a hurry and plunged
headlong down to the long tunnel, where
he knew he was safe. Above him he could<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
hear old Spot barking, and Johnnie Green
talking. But he was no longer afraid.</p>

<div class="pad3"><a name="matter" id="matter"></a>
<div class="figcenter" style="width: 351px;">
<img src="images/illus-p36tn.jpg" width="351" height="500" class="bbox" alt="&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the Matter?&rdquo; Billy Asked" title="&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the Matter?&rdquo; Billy Asked" />
<span class="caption">&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the Matter?&rdquo; Billy Asked</span>
</div></div>

<p>Then suddenly Billy remembered that
he was a sentinel. And he had forgotten
to whistle! He had forgotten to warn his
father and his friends that they were in
danger!</p>

<p>Billy Woodchuck wondered what would
happen to them. Though Spot soon
stopped barking, Billy did not dare leave
his hiding place. He only hoped that the
old chucks had heard the noise and had
run away in time. Of course, he would be
very sorry if any of them should get
caught&mdash;especially his father. And yet
the more he thought, the surer he was that
if his father reached home the old gentleman
would be very angry. No matter what
happened, Billy Woodchuck saw that he
was in great trouble.</p>

<p>It was almost dark when Billy at last<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
left the old burrow and stole home. Even
before he had reached the end of the long
tunnel he could hear a loud groaning in
the family bedroom beyond.</p>

<p>It was his father. And as Billy slipped
inside the chamber he saw that his mother
was bending over Mr. Woodchuck and trying
to quiet him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter?&rdquo; Billy asked.</p>

<p>And at that Mr. Woodchuck sprang to
his feet. But his wife made him lie down
again. And she seemed pleased to see her
son once more.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Your father has been in a fight,&rdquo; Mrs.
Woodchuck said. &ldquo;When the dog chased
him he ran into an old woodchuck&rsquo;s burrow.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s just what I did, too!&rdquo; Billy exclaimed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes; but there was a weasel in the one
in which your father hid,&rdquo; his mother explained.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
&ldquo;And your poor father&rsquo;s nose is
badly bitten.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s all <i>his</i> fault,&rdquo; Mr. Woodchuck
said, meaning Billy, of course. &ldquo;He was
a sentinel&mdash;and he ran away without
warning us.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t have time,&rdquo; Billy whimpered.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If he were a soldier, he would be shot,&rdquo;
his father said, crossly.</p>

<p>Mrs. Woodchuck told her husband that
he had better try to go to sleep.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I said that Billy was too young to take
to the clover field,&rdquo; she reminded him.</p>

<p>Mr. Woodchuck groaned again.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Does your nose still pain you?&rdquo; she
asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s my back,&rdquo; he answered. &ldquo;I am
afraid I hurt it again. And I don&rsquo;t suppose
I shall be able to do another stroke
of work all the rest of the summer.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Somehow, that did not seem to worry<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
Mrs. Woodchuck at all. To tell the truth,
she knew very well that her husband was
lazy.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I shall punish this boy to-morrow&mdash;if
my back is strong enough,&rdquo; Mr. Woodchuck
said.</p>

<p>But the next day Mr. Woodchuck was
so busy sunning himself that he never
found time to punish Billy after all.</p>



<hr />
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span></p>
<h2><a name="VII" id="VII"></a>VII</h2>

<h2>GREEN PEAS</h2>


<p>In Farmer Green&rsquo;s garden there were
many things that Billy Woodchuck liked
to eat. It seemed to him that every time
he stole down there he found some new
vegetable that was nicer than any he had
tasted before. And one day he came upon
something that was far sweeter and juicier
than anything he had ever eaten.</p>

<p>Farmer Green&rsquo;s peas were just ready to
be picked. Billy Woodchuck did not know
what they were called. But that made no
difference to him. He sat up on his hind
legs and pulled off the fat pods and ate
the tender green peas greedily.</p>

<p>I should hate to say how long he stayed<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
there. But it was a very long time. When
he reached the garden-patch it had been
so early in the morning that none of
Farmer Green&rsquo;s family was astir. The
sun rose while Billy was breakfasting.
And after a while a door slammed now and
then. But Billy Woodchuck never heard
a sound, though the farmhouse was not far
away. He was having such a good meal
that he forgot everything else.</p>

<p>At last he could eat no more. He hated
to stop. But he could not hold another
mouthful. And now, as he looked around,
he was startled to see Farmer Green&rsquo;s
hired man walking toward him. The hired
man had a hoe on his shoulder; and he was
coming to work in the garden.</p>

<p>But Billy did not know that. He was
sure that the man was after <i>him</i>. So he
dropped down on all fours and started to
run. He really did <i>try</i> to run. But to his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
surprise he could only drag himself along
the ground.</p>

<p>The first thing that came into his head
was the thought that he had been poisoned.
He had heard of such things happening.
What else could be the matter? His hind
legs seemed too weak to hold up his body.
Yes! As he pulled himself slowly along,
his fat stomach actually dragged on the
ground.</p>

<p>Of course, he could not go fast at all.
But he managed to reach a shallow ditch,
where he hid and rested for a time, though
he expected any moment that the hired
man would pounce on him.</p>

<p>But nothing of the sort happened;
though he did hear the hired man say:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, look at that! What <i>will</i> Mr.
Green say when he knows this?&rdquo;</p>

<p>And that made Billy shiver all over.
For he knew exactly what the hired man<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
meant.</p>

<p>After a while he crept along the ditch.
He wanted to get home to his mother. And
at last he reached the pasture, pulled himself
through the long tunnel, and fell in
the middle of the chamber floor and wept.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, dear!&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t run any
more. I&rsquo;m afraid I can never run again.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mrs. Woodchuck took one look at him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What have you been eating?&rdquo; she
asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Some little green balls,&rdquo; Billy answered.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where have you been eating them?&rdquo;
she inquired. To tell the truth, she was
the least bit worried.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It was down in Farmer Green&rsquo;s garden,&rdquo;
he told her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah, ha!&rdquo; said Mrs. Woodchuck.
&ldquo;Green peas!&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Your father
told me this very morning that they were<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
ripe. You ate too many of them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Will I get better?&rdquo; Billy asked her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, indeed!&rdquo; she replied. &ldquo;But it&rsquo;s
lucky no man came and found you like
that. I don&rsquo;t believe you could ever have
got away.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Billy Woodchuck said nothing more
just then. But in a little while he asked
his mother another question:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is it because they are in Farmer
Green&rsquo;s garden that you call them <i>green</i>
peas, Mother?&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span></p>
<h2><a name="VIII" id="VIII"></a>VIII</h2>

<h2>A NEW GAME</h2>


<p>Billy Woodchuck and Jimmy Rabbit
often played together. Though they did
not look the least bit alike, they agreed
almost perfectly in one thing: they liked
the same good things to eat. There was
no place they would rather go than Farmer
Green&rsquo;s garden.</p>

<p>But after he had had a bad fright one
day, when dog Spot chased him away from
the lettuce-bed, Jimmy Rabbit did not go
near the garden for a long time. But he
could not forget the taste of that crisp lettuce.
So one day he said to Billy Woodchuck:</p>

<p>&ldquo;How would you like to play a new<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
game?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; Billy asked. &ldquo;If it&rsquo;s fun,
of course I&rsquo;d like it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well&mdash;did you ever play beggar?&rdquo;
Jimmy Rabbit asked him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No! What&rsquo;s it like?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s like this,&rdquo; Jimmy told him. &ldquo;You
sit up on your hind legs, hold your hands
in front of you, and let your head hang
over on one side. And whenever anybody
comes along you say: &lsquo;Please give me
something to eat! Nothing has passed
these lips for two days!&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;B-but I&rsquo;ve just had a good meal,&rdquo;
Billy said. &ldquo;And that wouldn&rsquo;t be true.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh&mdash;this is just a game,&rdquo; Jimmy
Rabbit said. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s all right. It&rsquo;s often
done. Everybody will understand.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, then&mdash;where shall I sit?&rdquo; Billy
Woodchuck asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d advise you to go down near Farmer<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
Green&rsquo;s garden,&rdquo; said Jimmy&mdash;&ldquo;there
are so many people passing that way.
I&rsquo;ll wait here for you. And when you get
enough food given you, you can bring it
right back here and I&rsquo;ll help you carry it
home.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Billy Woodchuck thought that was very
kind. So down he went toward Farmer
Green&rsquo;s garden. And near the fence, beside
the bridge across the brook, where
the field-people often passed, he sat up just
as Jimmy Rabbit had told him to.</p>

<p>Pretty soon he saw old Aunt Polly
Woodchuck come along with a basketful
of goodies which she had gathered in the
garden.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Please, ma&rsquo;am, I&rsquo;m hungry,&rdquo; Billy
said. &ldquo;Nothing has passed my lips for a
whole week.&rdquo; He thought &ldquo;a week&rdquo;
sounded far better than &ldquo;two days.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Now, Aunt Polly was a very old lady<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
and almost blind. She could not see how
Billy&rsquo;s fat sides stuck out. And though
she stopped and looked at him closely, she
did not know him&mdash;for all he was the son
of her own nephew.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My, my!&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;How hungry you
must be! Here&mdash;you just take this basket
and go right home and have a good meal.
I live &rsquo;way over there under the hill. And
you can bring my basket home to-night.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Billy Woodchuck thanked her. He felt
somewhat ashamed to take the peas and
lettuce and apples and clover-heads. But
he remembered it was only a <i>game</i>. And
Jimmy Rabbit had said it was all right.</p>

<p>Old Aunt Polly Woodchuck trudged
back to the garden again. And Billy hurried
back to the place where Jimmy Rabbit
was waiting.</p>

<p>&ldquo;See what I&rsquo;ve brought!&rdquo; he said
proudly. &ldquo;Now you take hold of the other<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
side of the basket and we&rsquo;ll carry it home
to my mother.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t do that if I were you,&rdquo; said
Jimmy Rabbit.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why not?&rdquo; asked Billy.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well&mdash;I just wouldn&rsquo;t. I forgot to
remember that it&rsquo;s bad luck not to sit right
down and eat whatever&rsquo;s given you like
this. And you don&rsquo;t want to have bad
luck.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Billy Woodchuck was sure he didn&rsquo;t.</p>

<p>&ldquo;All right, then!&rdquo; said Jimmy Rabbit.
&ldquo;And they say it&rsquo;s bad luck if you leave a
single scrap uneaten. So I&rsquo;ll sit down too,
and help you.&rdquo;</p>

<h2>AT AUNT POLLY&rsquo;S</h2>


<p>After Jimmy Rabbit and Billy Woodchuck
had eaten the very last goody in old
Aunt Polly Woodchuck&rsquo;s basket, Jimmy
said that he must hurry away at once.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you want to go with me while I
take her basket home?&rdquo; Billy asked him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d like to; but I can&rsquo;t,&rdquo; said Jimmy.
&ldquo;The basket&rsquo;s light, anyway. You won&rsquo;t
have any trouble carrying it.&rdquo; And that
was the truth. &ldquo;If you want to play beggar
again to-morrow, perhaps I can meet
you here once more,&rdquo; Jimmy added. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m
always glad to help a friend, you know.&rdquo;
And then he hopped away.</p>

<p>Billy Woodchuck trotted over to Aunt<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
Polly&rsquo;s house under the hill. He hoped
the old lady hadn&rsquo;t reached home yet, for
he was afraid she might know who he was
the next time she saw him.</p>

<p>Luckily she had not returned. And
Billy left the basket just outside the door
of her sitting-room and was hurrying back
through her neat tunnel, when he heard
voices.</p>

<p>And sure enough, as he crawled out of
Aunt Polly&rsquo;s front door, there sat the old
lady herself. And with her was Billy&rsquo;s
own mother, who had come over to pay a
call upon Aunt Polly and ask after her
rheumatism.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, if here isn&rsquo;t that poor little lad
right now!&rdquo; Aunt Polly exclaimed, the
minute she saw Billy Woodchuck. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s
just after bringing home my basket, I
know.&rdquo; She had been telling Billy&rsquo;s
mother about the starving youngster she<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
had found.</p>

<p>&ldquo;So this is the young beggar, is it?&rdquo;
Mrs. Woodchuck said. &ldquo;I must say he
looks very fat for a person who has had
nothing to eat for a week.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Aunt Polly felt of Billy&rsquo;s pudgy sides.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Dearie me! He doesn&rsquo;t seem thin, exactly,&rdquo;
she agreed. &ldquo;But you must remember
he has just had one good meal.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No doubt!&rdquo; said Mrs. Woodchuck.
&ldquo;And it&rsquo;s the fourth, at least, that he&rsquo;s had
to-day.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t say so! You know him,
then?&rdquo; asked Aunt Polly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m ashamed to say I do,&rdquo; Mrs. Woodchuck
answered. &ldquo;I never thought I
should be the mother of a beggar. But I
see that I am. It can&rsquo;t be helped this time.
But I know how to keep it from happening
again.&rdquo; She took hold of Billy&rsquo;s ear.
&ldquo;Come home with me, young man,&rdquo; she<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
said.</p>

<p>Billy Woodchuck began to whimper.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It was just a game!&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;We
were only playing. We were having fun.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;<i>We?</i> How many were there of you?&rdquo;
his mother asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Two of us&mdash;me and Jimmy Rabbit!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mrs. Woodchuck was too upset to notice
that Billy said <i>me</i> when he ought to

<h2>UNCLE JERRY CHUCK</h2>


<p>Not only Mr. Woodchuck, but his friends
as well, were angry with Billy, because
he forgot to whistle a warning to them,
when dog Spot caught them in the clover-patch.
And whenever they met Billy
Woodchuck anywhere they would scold
at him, and tell him that he was a heedless,
careless boy.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It will be a long time before you have
another chance to be a sentinel and listen
for danger,&rdquo; Uncle Jerry Chuck told him.</p>

<p>After he heard that, there was nothing
that Billy wanted to do so much as to stand
guard again. Before, he had been happy
and contented. But now that he learned<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
that there was something he mightn&rsquo;t do
he knew he should never be satisfied until
he did it.</p>

<p>Every day Billy went to one of his father&rsquo;s
friends and asked him if he didn&rsquo;t
want somebody to listen for him. But they
all told him that he was a good-for-nothing
rascal and bade him be off.</p>

<p>Finally Billy went to Uncle Jerry
Chuck&rsquo;s house and fairly begged the old
gentleman to let him do some listening.</p>

<p>The sly old gentleman had been waiting
for just that thing. He was very fond of
taking naps in the sunshine and he wanted
to find some youngster like Billy, with
sharp ears, to stay near him while he slept
and waken him in case some enemy should
see him.</p>

<p>Now, if Uncle Jerry had been willing to
pay them, he might have found plenty of
first-class listeners. But he was stingy.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
He was always trying to get something for
nothing. And now he said to Billy:</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll give you just one more chance.
Maybe you learned a lesson down in the
clover-patch. Perhaps you won&rsquo;t forget
to remember to whistle, after what happened
that time.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, Uncle Jerry!&rdquo; said Billy Woodchuck.
He was very polite. &ldquo;When may
I begin?&rdquo; he asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Right now!&rdquo; Uncle Jerry told him.
&ldquo;Come with me, up on top of the big
rock.&rdquo; And he walked off at once, with
Billy at his side.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But there&rsquo;s nothing for you to eat
there,&rdquo; said Billy.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Eat?&rdquo; Uncle Jerry exclaimed. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m
not going to eat. I&rsquo;m going to <i>sleep</i>.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So Uncle Jerry Chuck went to sleep on
top of the big rock. All the time he slept,
Billy Woodchuck sat upon his hind legs<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
and listened with all his might and main.
But his sharp ears caught no hint of danger.</p>

<p>After a while he began to wish that old
Spot would come along&mdash;or a skunk or a
fox. For it seemed as if Uncle Jerry
never would wake up again.</p>

<p>Billy wouldn&rsquo;t have minded quite so
much, if Uncle Jerry hadn&rsquo;t snored. But,
of course, that made it much harder to listen.</p>

<p>At last Uncle Jerry Chuck opened his
eyes and slowly rose to his feet and
stretched himself.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve done very well, for a beginner,&rdquo;
he told Billy. &ldquo;Come back here to-morrow
at the same hour and I&rsquo;ll try you
again.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Now, Billy Woodchuck had done
enough listening to last him for a long
time. But he didn&rsquo;t know just how to tell<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
that to Uncle Jerry. And almost before
he knew it he found himself saying:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir!&rdquo;</p>



<hr />
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span></p>
<h2><a name="XI" id="XI"></a>XI</h2>

<h2>BILLY ASKS FOR PAY</h2>


<p>The next day, at the same hour, Uncle
Jerry Chuck went to the big rock. This
time he was looking forward to even a
longer nap in the sun than he had had the
day before. If Billy Woodchuck was willing
to listen, without pay, Uncle Jerry was
more than willing to let him.</p>

<p>Billy Woodchuck was somewhat late.
But he arrived at last.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You must be more prompt,&rdquo; Uncle
Jerry told him, severely. &ldquo;I have no time
to waste waiting for a young chap like
you. When I&rsquo;m good enough to let you
do my listening, it seems to me you ought
to be on time,&rdquo; he grumbled. That is often<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
the way with people who get things for
nothing. They are very likely to find
fault.</p>

<p>Now, Billy Woodchuck had been doing
some thinking since the day before. And
while Uncle Jerry was hunting for a soft
spot on the big rock, where he could lie,
Billy suddenly surprised him by saying:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you think you ought to pay me
for listening for you, Uncle Jerry?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Uncle Jerry grunted. He was not at all
pleased.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This is not a good time to speak of
<i>pay</i>,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I am so sleepy that I can
hardly keep my eyes open. However, I&rsquo;ll
see what I can do for you&mdash;after I&rsquo;ve had
my nap.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And then he fell asleep, and snored ever
so much louder than he had the previous
day. He slept longer, too. And by the
time he awakened, Billy Woodchuck was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
quite worn out, and ready to fall asleep
himself.</p>

<p>This time Uncle Jerry did not wait to
stretch himself. As soon as he opened his
eyes he leapt to his feet and started off.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Meet me here to-morrow at the same
hour,&rdquo; he ordered.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But you haven&rsquo;t paid me for to-day!&rdquo;
Billy Woodchuck cried.</p>

<p>Uncle Jerry stopped.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I declare, I&rsquo;d forgotten all about
that,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you what I&rsquo;ll
do.... You know, turn about is fair
play. So if you want to take a nap, you
can lie right down here and take it. And
I&rsquo;ll do more for you than you did for me.
I&rsquo;ll keep track of the time. And when the
sun gets over the big elm by the brook, I&rsquo;ll
wake you up.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Billy Woodchuck agreed. And as soon
as he was fast asleep Uncle Jerry left him.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
You see, old Uncle Jerry Chuck was a sly
old gentleman. He had said nothing at
all about listening for danger.</p>

<p>So Billy Woodchuck slept on.</p>

<p>If the Great Horned Owl had happened
along then, he could have caught Billy
without any trouble.</p>

<p>But it was not Mr. Owl who passed that
way, before the sun climbed above the big
elm. Though some one did spy Billy, as
he lay there sleeping.</p>

<p>Who do you suppose it was?</p>

<h2><a name="XII" id="XII"></a>XII</h2>

<h2>WHAT JIMMY RABBIT SAW</h2>


<p>It was Jimmy Rabbit who came along
and caught sight of Billy Woodchuck,
sound asleep on top of the big rock.</p>

<p>Jimmy was surprised. It seemed to him
that it was a very careless thing to do.
And while he was wondering whether he
would just waken Billy, or play some trick
on him, he saw Uncle Jerry Chuck come
puffing up the hill and go to Billy and give
him a good, hard shake.</p>

<p>Billy Woodchuck at once jumped up,
rubbing his eyes to get the sleep out of
them. And Uncle Jerry started to waddle
down the hill. But before he had gone
far he turned around; and Jimmy Rabbit<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
heard him call:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Remember! To-morrow at the same
hour!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Jimmy wondered what he meant. He
waited till Uncle Jerry was out of sight
and then he stepped out from behind the
blackberry bush where he was hiding and
hopped over to the big rock.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hello, Billy!&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s going
on to-morrow?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I listen, while Uncle Jerry sleeps,&rdquo;
Billy explained. &ldquo;And then, after he&rsquo;s
had his nap, I sleep while he listens.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, ho!&rdquo; said Jimmy Rabbit. &ldquo;And
<i>where</i> does he listen&mdash;if I may be so bold
as to ask?&rdquo; So long as he put his questions
like that, Jimmy Rabbit always
seemed to think that he could ask anyone
anything he wanted to.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, he listens <i>here</i>,&rdquo; said Billy.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What makes you think so? Did he say<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
he would?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes&mdash;er&mdash;n-no! He said he would
wake me up at this time,&rdquo; said Billy.
&ldquo;But, of course, he was right here all the
while.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course he was <i>not</i>!&rdquo; said Jimmy.
&ldquo;When I first came along, you were all
alone. And pretty soon I saw Uncle Jerry
come up the hill and shake you. I tell you,
it&rsquo;s lucky for you nothing happened, while
you were taking your nap.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Billy Woodchuck saw that he had been
tricked. And he was very angry. He was
so angry that he wanted to run straight
down to Uncle Jerry&rsquo;s house and tell him
just what he thought about him.</p>

<p>But Jimmy Rabbit said &ldquo;No!&rdquo; He
knew something better to do than that.
&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s see&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t I hear
Uncle Jerry mention something about &lsquo;to-morrow
at the same hour&rsquo;?&rdquo; he asked.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Y-y-e-s-s!&rdquo; Billy Woodchuck was so
angry that his teeth were chattering and
clattering; and he found it very hard to
talk.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, then&mdash;you just lie low until
to-morrow. Meet him here. Let him fall
asleep. And then we&rsquo;ll teach him a good
lesson.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Billy liked that idea. He liked it so well
that he could hardly wait for to-morrow
to come.</p>

<h2><a name="XIII" id="XIII"></a>XIII</h2>

<h2>A JOKE ON UNCLE JERRY</h2>


<p>Well, the third day Uncle Jerry Chuck
once more climbed to the top of the big
rock to take his nap in the sun. And this
time Billy Woodchuck was there ahead of
him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good!&rdquo; said Uncle Jerry. &ldquo;I see
you&rsquo;re trying to do better. You&rsquo;re not
late to-day.... Now, keep a sharp ear
out while I&rsquo;m asleep. And don&rsquo;t forget to
give a loud whistle the moment you hear
the least noise that&mdash;sounds&mdash;like&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
He was asleep even before he finished what
he had started to say. And after taking
a good look at him, Billy Woodchuck tiptoed<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
away to a spot where he saw two long
ears sticking out from behind a clump of
milkweed.</p>

<div class="pad3"><a name="stripes" id="stripes"></a>
<div class="figcenter" style="width: 350px;">
<img src="images/illus-p68tn.jpg" width="350" height="500" class="bbox" alt="He Painted Two White Stripes on Uncle Jerry&rsquo;s Back" title="He Painted Two White Stripes on Uncle Jerry&rsquo;s Back" />
<span class="caption">He Painted Two White Stripes on Uncle Jerry&rsquo;s Back</span>
</div></div>

<p>&ldquo;Is he asleep?&rdquo; Jimmy Rabbit whispered.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes!&rdquo; said Billy.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then help me carry these pots of paint
up where that old fraud is,&rdquo; said Jimmy
Rabbit.</p>

<p>Billy Woodchuck obeyed. There was a
pot of black paint and a pot of white. And
besides all that, Jimmy had a whole armful
of Indian paint brush, which grew
thick in Farmer Green&rsquo;s pasture. He gave
Billy Woodchuck a brush.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now,&rdquo; he whispered, &ldquo;we&rsquo;ll paint this
old fellow black.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Between them they soon covered Uncle
Jerry Chuck with a thick coat of the black
paint. And then Jimmy Rabbit stood off
and squinted at the sleeper.</p>

<p>&ldquo;So far, so good!&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;And now<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
for the last touch of all! This has to be
put on with care, so I shall do it myself.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And Billy Woodchuck watched him
while he painted two broad, white stripes
the length of Uncle Jerry&rsquo;s back. They
began on the top of his head, so close together
that they made just one line, and
ended far apart, on either side of his tail.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There!&rdquo; Jimmy Rabbit whispered,
when he had finished. &ldquo;Does he look like
anyone you know?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He looks exactly like Henry Skunk&rsquo;s
father,&rdquo; said Billy Woodchuck. And he
backed away. He was afraid of the Skunk
family. &ldquo;What are we going to do now?&rdquo;
Billy asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;First of all, we&rsquo;ll hide these pots of
paint,&rdquo; said Jimmy. And as soon as they
had done that Jimmy added: &ldquo;Go up on
the rock, whistle as loud as you can, and
then run.... I&rsquo;m going to hurry down<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
the hill and see the fun.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Billy Woodchuck did exactly as he was
told. And in no time at all his shrill whistle
had awakened Uncle Jerry Chuck.</p>

<p>The old gentleman sprang up. He saw
Billy, scurrying toward home. And without
so much as a glance behind him to see
what the danger might be, Uncle Jerry
tore down the hill. He didn&rsquo;t know what
was chasing him; but he was sure there
was something.</p>

<p>On the way home he met Billy Woodchuck&rsquo;s
father. And when Mr. Woodchuck
saw him he fell right over backward,
he was so frightened. For he, too, was
afraid of the Skunk family.</p>

<p>Uncle Jerry thought that was queer.
But he didn&rsquo;t stop. He ran into his house.
And there another queer thing happened.
The moment his wife caught sight of him
she gave a scream and rushed out of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
back door.</p>

<p>And for a long, long time after that
there wasn&rsquo;t one of Uncle Jerry&rsquo;s family
or his friends who would have anything to
do with him.</p>

<p>He noticed another strange thing, too.
Jimmy Rabbit and Billy Woodchuck were
always following him. And whenever
Uncle Jerry turned around quickly he was
sure to catch them laughing.</p>

<p>But whatever the joke was, he never
could see it.</p>



<hr />
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span></p>
<h2><a name="XIV" id="XIV"></a>XIV</h2>

<h2>MR. FOX HAS AN IDEA</h2>


<p>It was so long since Mr. Fox had tried
to catch Billy Woodchuck in the hollow
stump that Billy had begun to forget his
fear of that sly fellow. And so when he
met Mr. Fox in the woods one day Billy
did not run as he had often done before.
To be sure, he did not go too near Mr.
Fox. And while they talked Billy watched
the sharp-nosed gentleman with one eye;
and the other eye he kept on a hole in the
stonewall nearby. If Mr. Fox should come
too close, Billy was ready to dive into that
hole, where Mr. Fox could not reach him.</p>

<p>No one could have been pleasanter than
Mr. Fox. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m so glad to meet you!&rdquo; he<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
said. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re just the person I want to
see. I&rsquo;ve been told you are very musical.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Billy Woodchuck didn&rsquo;t know what he
meant. But he did not say so.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Mr. Fox went on. &ldquo;They say
you are the best whistler in Pleasant Valley.&rdquo;</p>

<p>That made Billy Woodchuck feel very
proud.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I <i>can</i> whistle pretty well,&rdquo; he said,
throwing out his chest.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And they tell me your two brothers are
almost as good whistlers as you are&mdash;but
not <i>quite</i>,&rdquo; added Mr. Fox, for he saw that
Billy did not like that so well.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, they can whistle some. But I can
beat them,&rdquo; Billy answered.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have an idea,&rdquo; said Mr. Fox. He
really had a great many ideas in his head&mdash;more,
probably, than any other of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
forest-people. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m very fond of music
and I want to have a fife-and-drum
corps.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s that? I never heard of such
a thing,&rdquo; exclaimed Billy Woodchuck.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Fifes and drums&mdash;they make music,
you know,&rdquo; Mr. Fox explained. &ldquo;Now,
everybody knows that old Mother
Grouse&rsquo;s sons are famous drummers.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Billy agreed that that was true. He had
often heard the Grouse boys drumming in
the woods.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve already spoken to them. And they
are asking me every day when we are going
to begin to practise,&rdquo; Mr. Fox continued.
&ldquo;But I couldn&rsquo;t think of any fifers
until I happened to remember about you
and your brothers.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know how to play a fife,&rdquo; said
Billy. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve never even seen one.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, that&rsquo;s nothing! You can hold a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
stick up to your mouth, and wriggle your
fingers, and whistle. No one will know
that you are not playing a fife. It will
sound just the same. And the music will
be just as sweet.&rdquo; Mr. Fox smiled at
Billy. And Billy smiled at him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good!&rdquo; said Billy. &ldquo;Will you bring
the drummers to my house?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well&mdash;no! Not just yet!&rdquo; said Mr.
Fox. &ldquo;We ought to go off in the woods,
where nobody can hear us, until we learn
a tune. Then we can come and play for
your mother. But I wouldn&rsquo;t say anything
to her about the fife-and-drum corps
if I were you. Let&rsquo;s surprise her!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Billy thought that was a good idea.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Bring your brothers over to my house
late this afternoon,&rdquo; Mr. Fox said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll
have the Grouse boys there. And we can
begin to learn to make music at once.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who will teach us?&rdquo; asked Billy. &ldquo;Do<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
<i>you</i> know how to drum or whistle?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you worry about that!&rdquo; Mr. Fox
answered. &ldquo;I can teach you a thing or
two.&rdquo; And he hurried away to find
Mother Grouse&rsquo;s sons and tell them the
good news.</p>



<hr />
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span></p>
<h2><a name="XV" id="XV"></a>XV</h2>

<h2>&ldquo;POP! GOES THE WEASEL!&rdquo;</h2>


<p>Just as he had promised, Billy Woodchuck
led his two brothers to Mr. Fox&rsquo;s
house late in the afternoon, to join the
fife-and-drum corps, and make sweet
music.</p>

<p>The Grouse boys&mdash;all four of them&mdash;were
already there and waiting to begin.
And Mr. Fox was all smiles.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go further into the woods,&rdquo; he
said. &ldquo;I know a fine place, where we
won&rsquo;t be disturbed.&rdquo; He had noticed that
old Mr. Crow was sitting in the top of a
tall elm, and he did not care to have the
old gentleman see what was going on.</p>

<p>So they followed Mr. Fox. And after<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
a while he stopped close by a broad brook.
He told Billy and his brothers just where
to stand, and how to hold their short sticks
so they would look like fifes.</p>

<p>The Grouse boys perched themselves
high up on the trunk of a dead tree, which
had fallen against a big oak and lay slanting
between the oak and the ground.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Come right down here!&rdquo; Mr. Fox said
to them.</p>

<p>But the Grouse brothers told him that
they could drum much better where they
were.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What tune are we going to learn?&rdquo;
Billy Woodchuck asked.</p>

<p>Mr. Fox thought for a moment. And
then he said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;The first tune will be &lsquo;Pop! Goes the
Weasel.&rsquo;&rdquo; He hummed it to them. And
soon the Grouse boys began to drum; and
Billy Woodchuck and his brothers began<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
to whistle.</p>

<p>Though they played very badly, Mr.
Fox declared again and again that he was
much pleased.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But I seem to be a little too near the
music,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I want you all to face
<i>that</i> way,&rdquo; he went on, pointing a paw
over his shoulder. &ldquo;And please keep on
playing while I go off and see how the tune
sounds further away.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So they began to play &ldquo;Pop! Goes the
Weasel,&rdquo; once more, while Mr. Fox, beating
time all the while, backed slowly out
of sight in the direction in which he had
pointed.</p>

<p>They played and played. And at last
Billy Woodchuck&rsquo;s lips began to feel very
queer, puckered up as they were. And
now and then not a single whistle came
from his mouth, though he blew as hard as
he knew how. He was out of breath, too.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
And so were his brothers.</p>

<p>Billy was wondering why Mr. Fox did
not come back, when his sharp ears caught
a faint sound. It was no more than a dry
leaf breaking. Neither you nor I could
have heard it.</p>

<p>In spite of what Mr. Fox had said about
looking straight ahead, Billy turned
around. And he was always glad, afterward,
that he had. For whom should he
see behind him but Mr. Fox, stealing upon
them with a horrid grin on his face!</p>

<p>The music stopped short. With one
frightened scream Billy Woodchuck was
off. He plunged into the brook, with his
brothers right at his heels. And in no time
at all they had swum across to the other
side and vanished in the thick bushes.</p>

<p>At the water&rsquo;s edge Mr. Fox paused. If
there was one thing he hated, it was getting
his feet wet. The brook was too<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
broad for him to jump; and when at last
he found a place where he could cross by
hopping from one stone to another, the
Woodchuck boys were nowhere to be
found.</p>

<p>But the Grouse brothers still sat on the
dead tree, though they had moved to its
very top; and they had stopped drumming.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How did the music sound?&rdquo; one of
them asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It was the worst I ever heard,&rdquo; Mr.
Fox snarled.</p>

<p>The Grouse brothers snickered. And
one of them invited Mr. Fox to come up
where they were.</p>

<p>But he never even thanked them.</p>



<hr />
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span></p>
<h2><a name="XVI" id="XVI"></a>XVI</h2>

<h2>THE PLAY-HOUSE</h2>


<p>As Billy Woodchuck grew bigger he was
often to be seen digging holes in the pasture.
You might think he was looking for
something. But he was not. He was
merely playing at making houses.</p>

<p>First he would dig a slanting hole down
into the ground. And then from the bottom
of that he would run a level tunnel.
When his tunnel was as long as he wanted
it, he would work his way upward for a
short distance. And there he would make
a chamber, much like the one at home.</p>

<p>Of course, Billy&rsquo;s play-houses were not
so big as his mother&rsquo;s home. The front
stairs were shorter, and the hall was not<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
so long, and the chamber was smaller. But
he thought they were wonderful. And he
made up his mind that the next time Johnnie
Green or dog Spot chased him he
would run down into one of those play-houses
and hide. Billy hoped that he
would be chased soon.</p>

<p>He did not have to wait long. One evening
when old Spot had started the last cow
homeward he lingered in the pasture a
while. If there was one thing he liked, it
was chasing woodchucks.</p>

<p>When Billy Woodchuck caught sight of
Spot, sniffing along the ground, he climbed
up on a hummock, so that Spot could see
him, and gave a loud whistle.</p>

<p>It didn&rsquo;t take old Spot long to see Billy.
And as soon as he spied him he made a
dash for him.</p>

<p>That was exactly what Billy Woodchuck
wanted. He waited as long as he<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
dared. And then he made off like a gray
streak toward his newest house.</p>

<p>Old Spot saw his bushy tail disappear
through the front door. And Spot looked
down into the darkness and called Billy
a few names.</p>

<p>He pawed and scratched at the door, too.
But he was no such digger as Billy Woodchuck.
And after a while he grew tired
of staying there and went away.</p>

<p>That night, after Billy Woodchuck
went home, he boasted about his newest
play-house.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s exactly as good as this one,&rdquo; he
bragged. &ldquo;To-day old Spot chased me,
and I ran into my house and he never
touched me. After this I&rsquo;m always going
to hide there.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Billy&rsquo;s brothers and sisters thought he
was very clever. But his mother said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;I want to see that play-house. To-morrow<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
you may show it to me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>That pleased Billy. It made him feel
prouder than ever. And the next morning
he was up bright and early. Sometimes
he was very slow about dressing, because
he stopped to play. And that made him
late to breakfast. But this morning he
was even ahead of time.</p>

<p>As soon as Mrs. Woodchuck had finished
her meal of plantain leaves, Billy
reminded her that she had promised to
look at his play-house.</p>

<p>She followed him through the front
door that he had made, walked to the end
of the tunnel, and into the tiny chamber.</p>

<p>Once inside that room Mrs. Woodchuck
took one quick look all around. And then
she turned and ran out as fast as her short
legs would carry her, calling all the time
to Billy to hurry. When she reached the
open air Mrs. Woodchuck had to sit down<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
and fan herself, she was so excited.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why did you come out so soon&mdash;and
so fast?&rdquo; Billy asked her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s nothing but a trap,&rdquo; his
mother said. &ldquo;You haven&rsquo;t built any
back door. And if a weasel or a mink or
a snake should come in after you, there
you&rsquo;d be, with no way to escape.... I
haven&rsquo;t had such a fright for years.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Billy Woodchuck looked foolish. He
had never once thought about a back door.
But after that he never forgot to build
one. He saw that a back door was something
that every house ought to have.</p>

<h2>BILLY BRINGS THE DOCTOR</h2>


<p>Billy Woodchuck was alarmed. His
mother had come home very ill. At least,
that was what Billy thought. It was a
warm summer&rsquo;s day; but Mrs. Woodchuck
seemed to be freezing with cold. Her
teeth chattered so hard that the sound
filled the whole house. And when Billy
asked her what was the matter with her
she did not say a word.</p>

<p>Then he was sure she was ill. For she
was a great talker. This was the first time
he had ever seen her when she could not
speak.</p>

<p>Now, Mr. Woodchuck was not at home.
And none of the children knew what to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
do. So Billy left the house and hurried
over to find Aunt Polly Woodchuck&mdash;an
old lady who was a famous herb doctor.
Woodchucks for miles around came to see
her when they were not feeling well. And
she would give them a peppermint leaf to
chew, or some tansy, or maybe a drink of
catnip tea. And everybody said that her
medicines never did anyone a bit of harm.</p>

<p>Luckily, Billy found Aunt Polly at
home. And he quickly told her about his
mother.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You say her teeth chatter?&rdquo; the old
lady asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, Aunt Polly!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do they make a clattering noise?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, Aunt Polly!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Aunt Polly Woodchuck nodded her
head wisely.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I thought so,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;It sounds to
me like chills-and-fever. I&rsquo;ll go right back<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
with you and see what I can do to help
her.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So Aunt Polly and Billy started off together.
Though he carried her basket of
herbs, they could not go very fast, for the
dear old lady was half blind.</p>

<p>But at last they reached Billy&rsquo;s home.
And there they found his mother, sweeping
the floor as spryly as if she had never
known a sick day in her whole life.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I see you&rsquo;re feeling better,&rdquo; said Aunt
Polly. &ldquo;Your son told me you were ill
and I came right over.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mrs. Woodchuck thanked her. And
then she sent all the children out to play.
As soon as they had left the room she said
to Aunt Polly:</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wasn&rsquo;t ill at all. I am ashamed to
say that I was just angry. And since you
are a near relation of ours, I&rsquo;ll tell you
the reason. I&rsquo;ll tell you what happened.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span></p>

</div></div>

<p>&ldquo;Yesterday Johnnie Green dropped a
big stone through our front door. It almost
filled the end of my hall, so I could
hardly squeeze past it. And this morning
I asked Mr. Woodchuck to help me dig
around the stone. But he said his rheumatism
was so bad that he couldn&rsquo;t do a
bit of work. And then he went off and
stayed away all the rest of the day.</p>

<p>&ldquo;After I had done the work myself I
went out to get a little fresh air and a bite
to eat. And over in the meadow, what do
you suppose I saw? There was a baseball
game going on. And Mr. Woodchuck was
playing so hard that he never noticed me
at all.... Do you wonder I was
angry?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Old Aunt Polly said it was a shame.
And she found a bit of celery in her basket,
which she gave to Billy&rsquo;s mother.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Just eat that!&rdquo; Aunt Polly said. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
good for the nerves.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mrs. Woodchuck thanked her again.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wish you could give my husband
something that would make him work,&rdquo;
she said.</p>

<p>But for once old Aunt Polly Woodchuck
didn&rsquo;t have the right sort of medicine.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Laziness,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;is terribly hard
to cure.&rdquo;</p>



<hr />
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span></p>
<h2><a name="XVIII" id="XVIII"></a>XVIII</h2>

<h2>A WONDERFUL STICK</h2>


<p>Now, Billy Woodchuck knew that he
must beware of boys like Johnnie Green.
And more than that, he had learned that
boys with sticks are even worse than boys
without them. Still, if he did not let
Johnnie come too near him, there was not
much danger.</p>

<p>So he was not at all frightened when he
happened to catch sight of Johnnie Green
crossing the pasture with a long stick over
his shoulder. He was so far away that
Billy Woodchuck sat up on a little hummock
and watched him.</p>

<p>Pretty soon the boy saw Billy. And the
moment he spied him he stopped and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
pointed the long stick at the plump young
chuck.</p>

<p>That made Billy Woodchuck smile. He
was not the least bit afraid. For if Johnnie
Green should come nearer he intended
to pop inside his mother&rsquo;s door.</p>

<p>The next moment Billy Woodchuck
heard a sound just above his head&mdash;a
sound like the sighing of the wind in
the top of a pine tree. He thought that
was very queer, for there was no wind at
all that morning. And there was not a
tree near him.</p>

<p>Then it thundered. And yet the sun
was shining brightly and there wasn&rsquo;t a
cloud in the sky.</p>

<p>But as he looked once more at Johnnie
Green he was astonished to see a small
cloud float from the end of that long stick
and lose itself in the air.</p>

<p>All at once Billy Woodchuck was frightened.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
He was afraid of Johnnie Green,
for he saw that it was Johnnie who made
the wind blow, and turned loose the thunder
and the clouds. He noticed that Johnnie
was doing something to that strange
stick; and he expected that in another
minute it would begin to rain. But he
didn&rsquo;t wait to see. He felt that he would
be far safer indoors. So he scampered
straight home.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What are you shaking for?&rdquo; Mrs.
Woodchuck asked, as Billy burst in upon
her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m frightened,&rdquo; her son told her.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve just seen Johnnie Green making
thunder and wind and clouds.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Be careful!&rdquo; his mother said. &ldquo;You
know you are not allowed to tell tales.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But I <i>did</i> see him,&rdquo; Billy insisted.
&ldquo;He pointed a stick at me, and the wind
blew and it thundered; and I saw a little<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
white cloud come right out of the end of
the stick.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was Mrs. Woodchuck&rsquo;s turn to be upset.
And she shook even more than Billy
had as she said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;My goodness, child! That was a gun!
And it&rsquo;s a mercy you weren&rsquo;t shot. Don&rsquo;t
you stir out of this house again to-day&mdash;nor
<i>you</i>, nor <i>you</i>, nor <i>you</i>, nor <i>you</i>,&rdquo; she
repeated, pointing to each of her other
children.</p>

<p>And though Johnnie Green waited for
some time, to see if a black head would
not peep out of Mrs. Woodchuck&rsquo;s front
door, nothing of the sort happened until
after the sun had set and the cows had all
gone home for the night. And by that time
Johnnie Green was eating his supper.</p>



<hr />
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span></p>
<h2><a name="XIX" id="XIX"></a>XIX</h2>

<h2>MR. WOODCHUCK MOVES</h2>


<p>Mr. Woodchuck was annoyed. And he
had good reason to be. The weather was
fine and he had planned to spend the whole
day sunning himself on a big rock not far
from his own dooryard. But he had
scarcely found a comfortable seat for himself,
after finishing his breakfast, when
he caught sight of Farmer Green and his
hired man coming across the fields. They
were headed straight for the pasture.
And Mr. Woodchuck began to complain
so loudly about his rest being disturbed,
and how mean it was of Farmer Green to
come poking about other people&rsquo;s dooryards,
that Mrs. Woodchuck came to her<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
door to see what had happened.</p>

<p>As soon as she saw those men she called
her children all home. It was too bad.
But until the intruders had gone, their
underground house was the best place for
the whole Woodchuck family.</p>

<p>Mr. Woodchuck alone lingered in the
doorway. He made up his mind that he
would not go inside until he had to, anyhow.</p>

<p>A little later there came a terrible noise
like a clap of thunder. Even in their
house down there in the ground Mrs.
Woodchuck and her children felt the walls
shake.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What can have happened?&rdquo; she asked
her husband. He had come in somewhat
out of breath, soon after that frightful
sound.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It seems to be a new kind of gun,&rdquo; he
said, &ldquo;though I didn&rsquo;t notice that the men<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
brought one with them. It went off close
to an old stump; and you should have seen
the wood and dirt fly. The noise has given
me a headache. That is why I came into
the house.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Now, Mrs. Woodchuck knew him very
well. And though he tried not to let her
know it, she saw that he was scared. But
she did not mention <i>that</i> to him. There
were the children, you know. She didn&rsquo;t
want <i>them</i> to be frightened.</p>

<p>Now and then that booming, roaring,
thundering sound would burst upon their
ears again. And the earth would rock.
Each time that happened Mrs. Woodchuck
would go to her back door, where
she could not be seen easily, and peep out.
And what she saw filled her with fear.</p>

<p>Mr. Woodchuck did not help to make
the day any pleasanter, for he was forever
complaining about his lame back. He<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
claimed that he needed sunshine; and he
said that as soon as he could find time he
intended to report Farmer Green to the
Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to
Animals.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This is almost enough,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;to
make me move to the West. I have a
cousin who went there years ago. It
is a long way from here&mdash;at least a mile
the other side of Blue Mountain. Yes! I
would move at once&mdash;except that I will <i>not</i>
be driven out of my own house by anyone.&rdquo;
He looked so fierce as he said that
that Billy Woodchuck thought there
could be no braver person in the whole
world.</p>

<p>Then something happened that made
Mr. Woodchuck change his mind very
quickly. A roar ten times louder than any
of the others seemed to split their ears
apart. Their house was swept by a great<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
gust of wind&mdash;a thing that had never happened
before. And strangest of all! their
chamber became light as day!</p>

<p>That was when Mr. Woodchuck moved.
He did not stop to take even a pocket-handkerchief
with him. But then, he left
in a great hurry.</p>



<hr />
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span></p>
<h2><a name="XX" id="XX"></a>XX</h2>

<h2>THE FAMILY ESCAPES</h2>


<p>After that frightful noise, when her
house suddenly grew light, and her husband
ran away, Mrs. Woodchuck saw with
dismay that there was a big hole in the
ceiling. The earth had split open and the
daylight was streaming in.</p>

<p>Mr. Woodchuck had been gone only a
few moments when dog Spot began to
bark. Mrs. Woodchuck could not see him;
but she knew his voice only too well.</p>

<p>She was not quite sure what she ought
to do. But there she was, with her house
broken into, and five children on her
hands.</p>

<p>Though she was frightened, she was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
brave just the same. And she had not the
least idea of going anywhere without taking
her family with her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Follow me!&rdquo; she cried. And out of
the room she hurried, with her youngsters
close behind her.</p>

<p>Luckily, Mrs. Woodchuck&rsquo;s back door
was just out of sight of the men. They did
not see her at all while she waited and
counted her children as they came through
the doorway.</p>

<p>They were all there&mdash;all five of them.
And as soon as she had counted the fifth
one, Mrs. Woodchuck dashed off across
the pasture, in exactly the opposite direction
to that in which she could still hear
old Spot barking.</p>

<p>Soon they were in the woods. And Mrs.
Woodchuck led the way to an old empty
house, where her grandmother had once
lived. It was not so good a house as the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
one they had just left. But it was much
better than none at all.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mother! What was that dreadful
sound?&rdquo; Billy asked when they had begun
to get over their fright. His ears still
rang.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not sure,&rdquo; said Mrs. Woodchuck.
&ldquo;But it seemed to me that Farmer Green
was shooting away the stumps in the pasture.
Perhaps you didn&rsquo;t know that there
was an old stump quite near our bedroom.
And when the gun went off it must
have shot straight down into our house.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But father said he saw no gun,&rdquo; Billy
said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, I know he did,&rdquo; Mrs. Woodchuck
said. &ldquo;And neither did I. But I <i>smelled
powder</i>. So I can&rsquo;t be far wrong.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And, of course, the good old lady was
not. Perhaps you have already guessed
that Farmer Green was blasting away the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
stumps with powder. Anyhow, the Woodchuck
family had a narrow escape.</p>

<p>And as for Mr. Woodchuck, he was
never seen in those parts afterward.
When anyone asked for him, his wife always
said that he had gone on a visit
to see his cousin, who lived in the West,
and she really didn&rsquo;t know when he would
come back again. &ldquo;He didn&rsquo;t tell me
that,&rdquo; she would explain, &ldquo;for he left in
a great hurry. But I am looking for him
every day. The house is <i>so</i> quiet without
him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And that was quite true. For you see,
Mr. Woodchuck was always groaning and
complaining about his health.</p>

<p>Perhaps it agreed with him better where
he went.</p>



<hr />
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span></p>
<h2><a name="XXI" id="XXI"></a>XXI</h2>

<h2>AT HOME IN THE WOODS</h2>


<p>Mrs. Woodchuck was not so sorry, after
all, that she had to leave her home in
the pasture. You see, she always moved
twice a year, anyhow. Every fall she
went into the woods to live; and every
spring she returned to Farmer Green&rsquo;s
pasture. And every time that Mrs. Woodchuck
moved, she made a new house for
herself.</p>

<p>To be sure, there were plenty of chucks
that never went to all that trouble. They
were the lazy kind. They just hunted
around till they found an old, empty house
and then they moved in and made themselves
right at home. But that was not<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
the way of Billy Woodchuck&rsquo;s mother.
She wanted everything neat and clean.</p>

<p>You remember that when Farmer
Green blasted away the old stump near
Mrs. Woodchuck&rsquo;s bedroom he tore a hole
in the very roof of the house. And Billy
and his mother and his brothers and sisters
went into the woods and spent the
night in a house where his great grandmother
had once lived.</p>

<p>Mrs. Woodchuck said it would do, until
she could dig a new one.</p>

<p>The very next morning she started to
work. And all her children helped her.</p>

<p>Billy told his mother that they ought to
build the back door first of all. You see
he remembered what his mother had
taught him, early in the summer, when he
made his play-houses.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nonsense!&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Of course, we
must have a back door. But we must dig<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
it from the <i>inside up</i>, and not from the
<i>outside down</i>.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And she explained that when you build
a door by digging <i>down</i> into the ground,
there&rsquo;s always a heap of dirt about it,
which anybody can see. But when you
are out of sight in your tunnel you can dig
right <i>up</i> to the top of the ground and make
a small, round door, beneath a hummock of
grass, or a stone, or a stump. People must
have very sharp eyes to see a back door
that&rsquo;s made in that way, for the dirt all
falls <i>inside</i> your house.</p>

<p>With all the help she had, Mrs. Woodchuck&rsquo;s
new house was soon finished. But
it was done none too soon. She had
hardly carried in clean grass for the beds,
when her children began to feel very
sleepy. At least, all of them except Billy.
He was just as wide awake as his mother.</p>

<p>Even after his brothers and sisters had<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
been tucked up for their winter&rsquo;s nap he
was as spry as anything. And he told his
mother that he was not going to spend the
winter sleeping.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Jimmy Rabbit says that it&rsquo;s great fun
to play in the snow,&rdquo; he said.</p>

<p>Mrs. Woodchuck couldn&rsquo;t help smiling;
for at that very moment Billy was yawning
as wide a yawn as you ever saw on a
young chuck&rsquo;s face. Though he didn&rsquo;t
know it, he was already growing drowsy.
And his mother knew very well that no
matter how much he wanted to stay awake,
in a short time he would be sound asleep.</p>

<p>Though Jimmy Rabbit came to Billy&rsquo;s
house the very next day and called and
called to him, he never came out at all.</p>



<hr />
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span></p>
<h2><a name="XXII" id="XXII"></a>XXII</h2>

<h2>GROUND HOG DAY</h2>


<p>Billy Woodchuck had been asleep for a
long, long time. The world above was
white with snow. But no matter how hard
the cold winter winds might blow, or how
heavily the snow fell, in their underground
chamber Mrs. Woodchuck&rsquo;s family were
snug and warm in their beds.</p>

<p>At last one day late in the winter Billy
heard some one moving about. He was so
drowsy that at first he didn&rsquo;t stir. But
finally he opened an eye and saw that it
was his mother who had disturbed him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What is it, Mother? Has spring
come?&rdquo; Billy asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, my child,&rdquo; she answered. &ldquo;At<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
least, I do not know that it has.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then why are you getting up?&rdquo; Opening
both his eyes, Billy was surprised to
see that Mrs. Woodchuck was putting on
the warmest clothes she had. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re
not going out of doors, are you?&rdquo; he inquired.
His mother was already drawing
on a pair of thick, red mittens.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;This is Ground Hog
Day and I must go out and see what the
weather is like.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But I thought every day was Ground
Hog Day for us,&rdquo; Billy replied.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, you might say that it is,&rdquo; she
agreed. &ldquo;But this is different. To-day is
what <i>men</i> call Ground Hog Day.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;May I come with you?&rdquo; he asked. By
this time he was wide awake.</p>

<p>Mrs. Woodchuck looked at him somewhat
doubtfully.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Young ground hogs like you aren&rsquo;t<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
supposed to go out this time of year,&rdquo; she
said. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s still quite cold, you know.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Please, Mother!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, you must wear plenty of warm
clothing,&rdquo; his mother told him. And she
gave him so many coats to put on that
Billy would not have known himself if he
had looked in the surface of the brook.
Of course, he couldn&rsquo;t do that anyhow,
then, for the brook was covered with ice.</p>

<p>When Billy was ready they stole out of
the room, leaving the other children sound
asleep.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Whew!&rdquo; said Billy Woodchuck when
they stepped outside at last. &ldquo;How cold
it is!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The sun was shining brightly, for all
the air was so chilly. And Billy had a fine
time chasing his shadow around the pasture.
But he never could quite catch it.
Sometimes he thought he was going to.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
But whenever he made a pounce at it his
shadow moved just as quickly. And then
he had to begin all over again.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;d better go in,&rdquo; Mrs. Woodchuck
said at last. And she looked down rather
sadly at her own shadow, as if something
had disappointed her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, no!&rdquo; Billy pleaded. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s stay
out a while longer.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s too cold,&rdquo; his mother answered.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But just look at the sun! It&rsquo;s as
bright as can be. And I&rsquo;m not a bit sleepy.
Besides, I think spring will come now&mdash;maybe
to-morrow.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But Mrs. Woodchuck knew better.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;ll be forty more days of
winter,&rdquo; she said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How do you know that?&rdquo; he asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s the rule,&rdquo; she explained. &ldquo;If we
had not seen our shadows, that would
mean that spring was here; and I would<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
wake up your brothers and sisters. But
there are our shadows, as plain as can be!
And so we must go to bed again and sleep
forty days longer.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a silly rule,&rdquo; said Billy Woodchuck.
&ldquo;Who made it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t ask so many questions,&rdquo; Mrs.
Woodchuck answered. &ldquo;Do as I tell you.
Run in, now!&rdquo;</p>

<p>And Billy had to obey. He grumbled a
little. It seemed very foolish to him. And
once more he asked his mother who it was
that made such a horrid rule.</p>

<p>But Mrs. Woodchuck would not say
another word. To tell the truth, she did
not know the answer. She only knew that
it was so.</p>
